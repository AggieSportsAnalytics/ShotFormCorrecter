# Basketball Free Throw Corrector üèÄ

### üèÄ Detect and Improve Free Throw Technique using Computer Vision

The Basketball Free Throw Release Notifier project is an innovative application of computer vision aimed at assisting basketball players in enhancing their free throw technique. The precise moment of releasing the basketball and the follow-through are critical aspects of a successful free throw. This project combines the power of YOLOv8, an advanced object detection model, with OpenCV to detect the optimal release point, notify players about their timing, and evaluate their follow-through.

In this example, the system identifies the optimal release point for a free throw and provides real-time feedback to the player.

## üîë Key Features

Release Point Detection: The project utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify the basketball player's hands and the basketball. By analyzing their positions, the system determines the optimal moment for releasing the basketball during a free throw.
Timing Feedback: Once the release point is detected, the system provides instant feedback to the player. It notifies the player if the release is too early, too late, or optimal, helping them refine their timing.
Follow-Through Evaluation: After the release, the project continues tracking the player's hand movement to assess their follow-through. This information is crucial for maintaining a consistent and accurate shot.
Real-time Video Analysis: The system can process live video feeds from free throw practice sessions, offering immediate feedback to players. It can also be used to analyze recorded sessions for further improvement.
User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user interface that displays the video feed, the detected points, and feedback messages. This interface enhances the user experience and makes the feedback process intuitive.
## üöÄ Further Uses

Consistency Training: Apart from free throws, the project can be extended to provide feedback on various shooting techniques, helping players develop muscle memory and consistency in their shots.
Shot Analysis: The system's tracking capabilities can be used to analyze the trajectory of successful shots compared to missed ones. This information can help players adjust their aim and power.
## üéØ  Technology

YOLOv8: YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that accurately identifies objects in images and videos. It's employed here to detect the player's hands and basketball.
OpenCV: OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library used to process and analyze visual data. It's used for video capture, image processing, and drawing overlays.
NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It's used to manipulate and process numerical data efficiently.
## üìù Instructions

1. Install the required libraries: Make sure you have YOLOv8, OpenCV, and NumPy installed in your Python environment.
2. Configure the video source: Modify the code to use your camera or video file as the input source.
3. Run the script: Execute the script and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Interpret feedback: Pay attention to the real-time feedback provided by the system to improve your free throw technique.

Remember that while this project aims to assist players, consistent practice and refinement are key to mastering the art of the free throw. Enjoy practicing and watching your free throw percentage improve!
